# FYP-BackEnd
API interface between the databases and the UI for my final year project, the renewable energy trading platform.

To install dependencies:
```
npm install
```
To run in development mode (changing the files causes it to automatically restart):
```
npm run dev
```
To run normally:
```
npm run start
```
